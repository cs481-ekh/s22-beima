# Problem Statement

The Energy Infrastructure Management Department at Boise State University needs a system to easily track energy infrastructure information across campus. The application needs to map, record, display, and manage campus utility infrastructure data in a simple and effective manner.

# Solution
BEIMA satisfies this need by allowing university employees to take a location-tagged photo of a piece of equipment on their smartphone or tablet for upload. Using a desktop browser, the user inputs the equipmentâ€™s relevant characteristics, the location-tagged photo, and additional documents if needed. The entered information is populated into a searchable database so the user can access the interface and display it in an organized and user-friendly interface via lists and individual device views.

Lists can be filtered to show results that are relevant to the current need and exported on demand for reporting purposes.
