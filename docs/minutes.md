What everyone is working on right now:

## 4/12 Scrum

What everyone is working on right now:
* Joe - working on devicetype auth and then will move on to building auth. doesn't have anything left to do after that, has a light task load, needs some more tasks.
* Keelan - busy weekend, still working on username case insensitivity, will put up PR soon after writing another test, also has light task load, needs more tasks
* Tom - Working through Docker networking issues (MinIO, Mongo)
* Ashlyn - Wrapping up authentication, has authentication working on front end
* Kenny - finishing up device filtering on front end and will start working on adding authentication on user endpoints

Keelan will assign backend tasks to Joe, and will take some of Ashlyn's front end tasks instead. Joe was assigned devicetype auth from Keelan, and then will work on adding default user upon first start.

Possible backend tasks:
* Create a default user on first start
* Add more MongoFilterGenerator filters

## Milestone 4 Demo

Likes:
* BEIMA does automatic data checking to prevent bad user input
* UI is clean and easy to use

Potential improvements:
* Being able to change device type of a current device (low priority)
* Mapping would be appreciated but not absolutely necessary (time constraints are understood)

Notes:
* Allow duplicate device tags
* If there is a duplicate device tag, then pop up a warning showing that there is a duplicate. Also show a warning that if they proceed, add a suffix to the device tag, and add some extra notes to help discern which one is which.

## Sprint 4 Planning Session

Sprint Goal:
Wrap up major pieces (authentication, filtering, building integration), write Docker file, and write documentation. We also want to clean up the UI and backend, leaving it in a state where we feel comfortable handing it off to another team.

What we did:
* Discussed goals for this upcoming sprint, prioritized different items
* Went through all existing tasks and assigned them priorities
* Created new tasks based on sprint goal
* Assigned all planned tasks to team members

Action Items:
* Send Dr. Henderson email saying we cannot bring a monitor to showcase (Kenny)
* Documentation writing meeting on Tuesday
* Ask Brian about whether we should enforce device tag uniqueness across device and building? Also need to ask if we are certain that device tag will be unique in each building. Also ask if there could be the same device tag across different device types.

## Sprint 2 Retro:
### Overall Thoughts
Very happy with the increased amount of tasks completed.
We did not meet sprint goal. Remaining tasks are very close
to being completed that will allow sprint goal to be met however.
### What went wrong
Task prioritization could have been better.
Big pr's could have been split out better.
Planned to many tasks in the sprint.
Tasks descriptions could be better.
Tests were broken on build machine, but worked on vm's
and personal pc's.
### What went well
We doubled the amount of completed tasks.
The work we are commiting is very good quality.
Code reviews have been really good.
### What can be improved
We should add more columns in the task board to show if a task is blocked.
Communication can still be improved.
Frontend tests will be disabled as they will sometimes not work only
on the build machine.
### Other notes:
PR Auther should be the one to close branch.
We should go back to merging into main instead of a sprint branch.
We should use tasknumber_description for branch names.
Reminder to use the chosen pr format message.

### Sprint goal template
	By the end of this sprint we will be able to run a
	simple version of our [app / webpage / data
	analysis / pipeline ] to demonstrate the initial
	functionality. We will have all interfaces between
	our [ components ] connected and roughed-in. We
	will have our testing framework implemented with
	1 unit test stub for each of our [ components ].

	will be set up and have at least 1 test set up. PRs will 
	automatically request reviews from all other members and 
	templates will be accessible for selection when creating new 
	bugs, tasks, stories, and epics.

## Items discussed:
* Introductions and history for each member
got history on our sponsor and what they want to accomplish
went over lisencing options and our suggestions for which to use
	* MIT decided  
* Went through the project plan draft to give Brian the overall view and timeline regarding our proposal
* Discussed data types needed to store information about the systems we will be catalogging
* Indicated that our system is going to be dynamic and allow custom associated fields for each piece
	* Brian wanted to be able to manually add geolocation if it was not contained in a photo metadata
	* Need to be able to store a manual or some other type of documentation to accompany the entry
		* most important capability would be to tie it to the specific device
* We were able to confirm that our Functional Requirements met his needs
	positively confirmed CSV files would be good for import/export
	Strongly indicated that a map interface is desired (we may not be able to call this a stretch)
	* wants to have the ability to filter the map based on chillers, HVAC, electrical, etc
	* we floated the idea of file storage based on geolocation
	* he floated the idea of exporting data in a configuration that could be imported into a google map interface
* Assumptions and Limitations were ok
* Showed the task decomp and how it tied to the timeline
mobile app/website are both acceptable, being able to load data on the road at all is desireable
	* Map over mobile is his preference
* If removing a device property, remove it across all devices of that type, warn with record count about removal to let the user make an informed decision
* Milestones and timeline were covered as well as an expectation being set to have a signoff on the project next week

* Request for schematic/diagram of the UI
	* not looking for anything super fancy, utilitarian is fine, just wants to see what we envision
* Comm frequency? 
	* wants to at least meet for the Milestone 3/4 demo, otherwise anything on Zoom if there's large issues to discuss will be played by ear
	* intermediate checkpoints? questions? email is fine to get answers, no need for official meetings to keep things moving
